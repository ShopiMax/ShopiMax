### Hi there 👋

Max is my name. I am a Swede who was born and raised in Sweden. 2017, my now wife imported me for the first time to Canada and I have essentially been here since then. During my time in Canada,I finished my Bachelor of Music and also finished my Master of Music in classical/operatic singing. Now I'm here as a Swedish advisor, helping the Swedish market to the best of my ability #merchantobssessed
